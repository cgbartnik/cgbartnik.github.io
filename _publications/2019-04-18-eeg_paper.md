In our latest EEG study, we investigate how the brain transforms visual inputs into neural representations of **locomotive action affordances** — such as walking, biking, or climbing — when viewing real-world scenes.

We found that affordance representations emerge within 200 ms of seeing a scene, distinct from earlier responses tied to objects or low-level visual features. These affordances are processed in **scene-selective brain regions** like the OPA and PPA, but with clear temporal differences: OPA activates earlier, while PPA contributes later in the processing stream.

Interestingly, **deep neural networks (DNNs)** — while predictive of early brain signals — fail to capture these later affordance-specific representations. This highlights a limitation of current AI models when it comes to modeling **goal-directed perception**.
