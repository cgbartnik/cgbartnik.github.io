# Oral presentation at CCN 2023 in Oxford on Scene Perception and Affordances  

I had the great opportunity to give a contributed talk at CCN 2023 in Oxford, where I presented our work on how the human brain perceives real-world affordances in scenes.

The conference was fantastic — an inspiring mix of neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI research — and it was a privilege to share our findings in such a historic setting. Out of more than 530 submissions, only 24 were selected for contributed talks, so I was especially honored to be part of this highly competitive program.
