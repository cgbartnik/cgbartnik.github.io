 Clemens Bartnik (1993) is a PhD candidate at the Video and Object Sensing (VIS) Lab of the University of Amsterdam, where they are supervised by Iris Groen and Cees Snoek. Their research explores the interface between human visual perception and computational vision, with a focus on how machines and minds represent and interpret visual information.

Before joining the VIS Lab, they obtained both a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. in Psychology from Otto Friedrich University Bamberg. Their Master's thesis, supervised by Ute Schmid at the Cognitive Systems Group, offered a quantitative comparison of visual saliency maps generated by convolutional neural networks and those derived from human attentionâ€”an early investigation into the shared and divergent priorities of artificial and biological vision systems.
