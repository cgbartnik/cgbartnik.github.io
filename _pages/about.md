 I'm Clemens Bartnik a PhD candidate at the Video and Object Sensing (VIS) Lab of the University of Amsterdam, where I am under the supervision of Iris Groen and Cees Snoek. The focus of my research is the interface between human visual perception and computational vision, with a particular emphasis on the manner in which machines and minds represent and interpret visual information.

Prior to joining the VIS Lab, I obtained both a B.Sc. and an M.Sc. in Psychology from Otto Friedrich University Bamberg. My Master's thesis, overseen by Ute Schmid from the Cognitive Systems Group, presented a quantitative comparison of visual saliency maps generated by convolutional neural networks and those derived from human attention. This represented an early investigation into the shared and divergent priorities of artificial and biological vision systems.
