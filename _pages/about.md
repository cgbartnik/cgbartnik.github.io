Hi, I’m **Clemens Bartnik** (1993) a Machine Learning Scientist and PhD candidate at the **Video and Image Sensing (VIS) Lab** at the University of Amsterdam. My work sits at the intersection of **human visual perception** and **computational vision**, where I explore how both brains and machines make sense of complex visual environments. I’m passionate about building AI systems that not only perform well, but do so in a way that is aligned with how humans understand and interact with the world.

In my research, I combine **state-of-the-art deep learning**, **fMRI and EEG**, and **behavioral experiments** to study how visual information is represented across biological and artificial systems. I often use approaches like representational similarity analysis to link neural data with computational models. 

Before joining the VIS Lab, I completed both my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Psychology at the **University of Bamberg**, where I worked with the Cognitive Systems Group on comparing visual saliency maps from convolutional neural networks with those derived from human attention. That project sparked my long-term interest in the shared principles and differences between artificial and biological vision.

Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring students, teaching courses in Explainable AI and Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, and building tools and analyses that make complex ideas clear and accessible. I’m motivated by technical challenges that bridge **machine learning**, **vision**, and **cognitive science**, and I’m always excited to collaborate on human-aligned AI and perceptual modeling.
