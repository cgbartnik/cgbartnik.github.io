Clemens Bartnik | Data Scientist

I am a Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience applying machine learning and statistical modeling to real-world problems in Human-AI alignment. I specialize in building end-to-end data solutions, from designing robust data pipelines and benchmarking deep learning models to communicating complex insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

In my PhD research at the University of Amsterdam I investigated how the brain extracts locomotive and navigational affordances from visual scenes. By integrating behavioral data with fMRI/EEG and deep neural networks, I mapped the neural and temporal dynamics of affordance perception and quantified fundamental gaps between human and model representations.

I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Iris Groen and Prof. Cees Snoek at the Informatics Institute (IvI). The projects that are part of my PhD thesis can be found in [Publications](/publications/).
