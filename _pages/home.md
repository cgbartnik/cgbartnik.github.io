#Hi, I'm Clemens Bartnik

##Data Scientist & ML Researcher specialized in Human-AI alignment.

I build end-to-end data solutions, from designing robust pipelines and benchmarking deep learning models to communicating complex insights to stakeholders. With 5+ years of experience, I focus on creating AI that better understands and reflects human-like perception.

##PhD Research

At the University of Amsterdam, I investigated how the brain extracts navigational affordances from visual scenes. By integrating behavioral data, fMRI/EEG, and Deep Neural Networks, I mapped the gaps between biological vision and machine learning representations.

I was advised by Dr. Iris Groen and Prof. Cees Snoek at the Informatics Institute (IvI). My thesis projects are available in [Publications](/publications/).
