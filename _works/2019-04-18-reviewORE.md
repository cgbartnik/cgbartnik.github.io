Our review on **scene perception in the human brain** has just been published in the *Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Neuroscience*.

We discuss object-, space-, and affordance-centered representations of scenes, summarizing behavioral, fMRI, and M/EEG evidence for their presence in the human brain. The paper also explores how computational modeling and deep learning can help elucidate these mechanisms.
